# About Me
Hey 👋 I’m Edoscoba — an independent blockchain security researcher dedicated to making decentralized systems safer. I actively participate in audit competitions on platforms like Code4rena, Sherlock, and Codehawks, where I specialize in uncovering and remediating smart contract vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

With a strong background in smart contract auditing, my approach combines deep technical analysis with practical insight to deliver actionable security reviews tailored to your protocol’s unique needs. Whether you're preparing for a secure launch or reinforcing an existing system, I bring a meticulous, attacker-first mindset to every audit.

Feel free to reach out through my socials for private audits, and explore some of my past findings and contest results below.
